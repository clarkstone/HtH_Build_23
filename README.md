I will be analyzing a dataset on Stars.

Here are my 10 questions:

1. What is the distribution of temperatures among different star types?
2. How does the luminosity vary with temperature for different spectral classes?
3. Are there any correlations between radius and absolute magnitude?
4. Which star color is most common among different star types?
5. What is the average luminosity for each spectral class?
6. Is there a relationship between the temperature and radius of stars?
7. How many stars are there for each spectral class?
8. What is the most common star type in the dataset?
9. Do certain star colors have higher luminosity on average?
10. How does the absolute magnitude vary with the star type?
